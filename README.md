# CarrierBagArchive
A speculative pseudocode artifact that treats code as a form of environmental humanities argument rather than as a tool for “solving” an environmental issue. The program imagines an archive that records small “environmental moments” as short narratives: each moment lists multiple co-present entities, a place, a time label, and a description.
